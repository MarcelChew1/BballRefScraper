For individual player we probably want a past season average points but also variance of points
Average shots taken per game and how it varies based on the game score
Probably can group games into blowout against, blowout for and close 
Average free throws per game 

Maybe based on how the team performed overall for the entire year on defense and see how it changes the player

See how their position matchup is and whether it affects each player

1. Variance of a players points & all player points to find which players have the most variance / per season / overall
2. Average shots per game and the variance to see if its directly correlated to points per game variance (it should be)
3. Group games into blowout against, blowout for and close for the game before to see how the variance of the previous two correlates
4. Check which teams have a lot of blowouts against / for compared to others
5. Free throws per game based on ref?
6. See how a each player performs against a certain defender and a certain team 

Project 1 

Figure out if player is on a hot streak or cold streak 

Go through the data split by season

The probabilities we are going to calculate:

- If the 2nd previous game is less than previous what is the chance this game will be higher
  - extend on this giving some sort of bound. If the previous game is more that 1 stdev away from the current game
- Is there a measureable amount that this will go up by
